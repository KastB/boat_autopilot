// I2Cdev library collection - MPU6050 I2C device class
// Based on InvenSense MPU-6050 register map document rev. 2.0, 5/19/2011 (RM-MPU-6000A-00)
// 8/24/2011 by Jeff Rowberg <jeff@rowberg.net>
// Updates should (hopefully) always be available at https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib
//
// Changelog:
//     ... - ongoing debug release

// NOTE: THIS IS ONLY A PARIAL RELEASE. THIS DEVICE CLASS IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING ACTIVE
// DEVELOPMENT AND IS STILL MISSING SOME IMPORTANT FEATURES. PLEASE KEEP THIS IN MIND IF
// YOU DECIDE TO USE THIS PARTICULAR CODE FOR ANYTHING.

#define GyroMeasError PI * (40.0f / 180.0f)       // gyroscope measurement error in rads/s (shown as 3 deg/s)

// There is a tradeoff in the beta parameter between accuracy and response speed.
// In the original Madgwick study, beta of 0.041 (corresponding to GyroMeasError of 2.7 degrees/s) was found to give optimal accuracy.
// However, with this value, the LSM9SD0 response time is about 10 seconds to a stable initial quaternion.
// Subsequent changes also require a longish lag time to a stable output, not fast enough for a quadcopter or robot car!
// By increasing beta (GyroMeasError) by about a factor of fifteen, the response time constant is reduced to ~2 sec
// I haven't noticed any reduction in solution accuracy. This is essentially the I coefficient in a PID control sense;
// the bigger the feedback coefficient, the faster the solution converges, usually at the expense of accuracy.
// In any case, this is the free parameter in the Madgwick filtering and fusion scheme.
#define beta sqrt(3.0f / 4.0f) * GyroMeasError   // compute beta
#define zeta sqrt(3.0f / 4.0f) * GyroMeasDrift   // compute zeta, the other free parameter in the Madgwick scheme usually set to a small or zero value
#define Kp 2.0f * 5.0f // these are the free parameters in the Mahony filter and fusion scheme, Kp for proportional feedback, Ki for integral
#define Ki 0.0f
